# Go Blog Aggregator

This is a project aimed at practicing my Go skills, created by [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).

The project demonstrates how to design a web server that scrapes a feed and stores posts in a PostgreSQL database.

## Build and start project

`go build -o out && ./out`
